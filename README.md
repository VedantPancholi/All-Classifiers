# Titanic Dataset Analysis [Classifier learning...]

## Overview
- This project is a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset. The dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including their survival status, demographic details, and ticket information. The analysis aims to extract insights, identify trends, and build predictive models for passenger survival. Through this project, I learned a lot about data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and machine learning.

## Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset includes the following columns:

- **PassengerId**: A unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third).
- **Name**: Name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: Amount of money the passenger paid for the ticket.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number (if available).
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Key Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handle missing data, correct inconsistencies, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the datasetâ€™s structure and identify significant features that influence survival.
3. **Model Building**: Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict survival.
4. **Insights and Visualizations**: Present findings through visualizations and actionable insights.

## Classifiers Used
The following machine learning classifiers were employed in this analysis:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)

Each model was trained, optimized, and evaluated to determine its performance in predicting passenger survival.

## Requirements
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Dependencies**:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure
- `titanic-dataset.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all the steps for data analysis, cleaning, EDA, and model building.
- `data/`: Directory containing the Titanic dataset (e.g., `train.csv`, `test.csv`).
- `outputs/`: Directory for saving plots, graphs, and model evaluation results.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VedantPancholi/All-Classifiers.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook titanic-dataset.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to replicate the analysis and build predictive models.

## Results
- Insights into passenger survival rates based on features like class, age, gender, and family size.
- Visualizations that highlight key trends and relationships in the data.
- A trained machine learning model to predict passenger survival with evaluation metrics.

## Future Work
- Extend the analysis by incorporating additional datasets or features.
- Explore advanced machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods.
- Deploy the predictive model as a web application or API for real-time predictions.
